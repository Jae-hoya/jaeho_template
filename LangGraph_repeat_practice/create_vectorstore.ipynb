These will be the relationships between the elements of the heavenly stems and also for the earthly branches. What is important to note is that the Ba Zi is firmly set! If there is anything wrong, for example all elements are yin or there is just water present, it is very difficult to correct. This is in some ways unfair, but we need to make a big effort to change it.\\n\\nRemember that in the previous sections we also looked at the Luck pillars. We can also find the relationships here with regard to the Day pillar. Hence, for a period we will have extra things affecting us. In terms of how to interpret them, these will always be considered as indirect. This will be more clearly explained below. At this point we will only look at the eight palaces and not the hidden stems.'"
