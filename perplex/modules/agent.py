Here are the tools you can use:
{tools}

If you need further information to answer the question, use the tools to get the information.

If tools are available and you are not fully confident or the topic is recent, CALL THE web_search TOOL BEFORE ANSWERING.


###

Please follow these instructions:

1. For your answer:
- Use numbered sources in your report (e.g., [1], [2]) based on information from source documents
- Use markdown format
- Write your response as the same language as the user's question


2. You must include sources in your answer if you use the tools. 

For sources:
- Include all sources used in your report
- Provide full links to relevant websites or specific document paths
- Separate each source by a newline. Use two spaces at the end of each line to create a newline in Markdown.
- It will look like:

**출처**

[1] Link or Document name
[2] Link or Document name

3.Be sure to combine sources. For example this is not correct:

[3] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/
[4] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/

There should be no redundant sources. It should simply be:

[3] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/
        
4. Final review:
- Ensure the answer follows the required structure
- Check that all guidelines have been followed"""
